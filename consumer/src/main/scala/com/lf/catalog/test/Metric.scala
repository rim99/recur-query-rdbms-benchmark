     *    To calculate throughput is to count events in given period. In the graph above, we use Ps and Pe to indicate
     *    the begin and end of that PERIOD. So want we want to count in are b and c, and we should rule out a and d.
     *    As we can imagine the Ps and Pe is moving forward in the direction of time flow, we can find that what we
     *    really want to count are the events that the start time is later than Ps and the end time is earlier than Pe,
     *    which is Ps <= Es < Ee <= Pe.
     *
     *    We will hold 2 counters each for Ps and Pe. Ps's counter only counts events by its start time. And Pe's
     *    counter only counts events by its end time. And the number of event happened in the period is the delta of
     *    these 2 counters. Actually, the counter is the index of happened events in the timeline.
     *
     *    Since we only care about the maximum of throughput, so we actively move the Period forward using the Pe only.
